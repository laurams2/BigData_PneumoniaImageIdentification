Pneumonia is an infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs that affects the small air sacs (alveoli) and the surrounding tissues. This condition can be caused by various infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi (Prayle, Atkinson, & Smyth, 2011). The infection leads to inflammation in the alveoli, which can cause them to fill with fluid or pus, making breathing difficult and causing severe symptoms (Torres et al., 2021).

Pneumonia is a significant public health concern worldwide due to its impact on morbidity and mortality, several factors contribute to the risk of developing pneumonia (Torres et al., 2021; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022):

•	Age: Young children and elderly individuals are at higher risk due to immature or weakened immune systems.
•	Immunological status: Immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or chronic diseases, are more susceptible.
•	Smoking: Tobacco smoking damages the lungs and weakens the immune system, increasing susceptibility to respiratory infections.
•	Environmental exposure: Exposure to pollutants like smoke, toxic chemicals, or air pollution can elevate the risk.
•	Underlying medical conditions: Chronic diseases like heart disease, chronic lung conditions, neurological disorders, or malnutrition increase vulnerability.

Prevention and control measures are crucial to addressing this ongoing public health challenge, including vaccination, respiratory hygiene promotion, and early identification and treatment of cases (Wee, Lye, & Lee, 2023).

Pneumonia can affect different parts of the respiratory system, and its complications may include respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, often requiring oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation (Torres et al., 2021). 

Common symptoms of pneumonia include cough, fever, shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. Diagnosis typically involves a chest X-ray and, in some cases, other tests such as respiratory or blood cultures. Treatment usually involves the use of antibiotics and, in severe cases, may require hospitalization and respiratory support. Prevention of pneumonia includes vaccination, practicing good hygiene, and maintaining a strong immune system (Torres et al., 2021).
The use of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting pneumonia from chest radiographs is a promising approach in medical imaging analysis. Machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, and random forests, analyze features extracted from chest radiographs to predict pneumonia (Ramgopal et al., 2022). Deep learning models like CNNs, such as DenseNet, ResNet, and VGG, automatically learn hierarchical features directly from raw images, achieving high accuracy and sensitivity in pneumonia detection (Sharma & Guleria, 2023; Kim et al., 2023). Proper data preprocessing, training, and validation techniques, including cross-validation and data augmentation, enhance model performance. Model evaluation is done using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC, with high sensitivity being crucial for accurate pneumonia diagnosis.
